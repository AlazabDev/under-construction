This is a very simple template that you can use to show when you are still working on your website. You can completely modify it to your liking and use it in whatever way you like. Contributions are welcome as there might be small and cool features that could be implemented in the feature.

## Setup & usage

To start, create a new folder for the landing page. Download or clone the repository by using `git clone https://github.com/Directoire/under-construction-template` and place the template in the folder you just created.

Go to `index.html`, here you can adjust the image and the text to your liking.
